    It has been exactly 3 years since I wrote my first blog series entitled
    “Flavorful Tuscany”, but starting it was definitely not easy. Back then, I
    didn’t know much about blogging, let alone think that one day it could

    and food-related stories to tell, it never crossed my mind that I could be
    sharing them with the whole world.

  <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li style="color: #34495e; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">📝 Your story (what do you want to tell your audience)</li>
    <li style="color: #34495e; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">🎯 Your audience (who do you write for)</li>
    <li style="color: #34495e; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">🎨 Your blog name and design</li>
  </ul>
