Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms.[1] Income is difficult to define conceptually and the definition may be different across fields.[2][page needed] For example, a person's income in an economic sense may be different from their income as defined by law.[2]

An extremely important definition of income is Haigâ€“Simons income, which defines income as Consumption + Change in net worth and is widely used in economics.[2]

For households and individuals in the United States, income is defined by tax law as a sum that includes any wage, salary, profit, interest payment, rent, or other form of earnings received in a calendar year.[3] Discretionary income is often defined as gross income minus taxes and other deductions (such as mandatory pension contributions), and is widely used as a basis to compare the welfare of taxpayers.
