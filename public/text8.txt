Leadership and motivation are deeply connected, with leaders providing direction and fostering environments that inspire teams to perform their best. Effective leaders use principles from motivation theories, which explain the internal and external forces driving people to act, to create a culture of high engagement, productivity, and loyalty. Key leadership strategies include setting clear goals, offering autonomy, providing resources, fostering open communication, and offering support, all of which cultivate intrinsic motivation and achieve organizational objectives.
